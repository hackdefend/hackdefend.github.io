I keep trying to involve SATs (structured analytic techniques) in my daily Cyber security analysis work. I also keep looking for ways to measure the improvement of SATs on the thinking process used to tackle or analyze cyber incidents. 

There really few publications on the topic with direct relation to cyber security.One example I found was a book by Sarah Miller "**Cases in Intelligence Analysis: structured Analytic Techniques**", The book practically apply SATs techniques in real world incident as examples  happened in the past. The techniques used are from another book **Structured Analytic Techniques** 

Apart from the great time spent with the book, I found chapter 3: discussing cyber attacks on critical infrastructure and what structured analytic techniques suits such cases.There were three techniques selected by author were:

- Decomposition and visualization using "getting started checklist technique"
- Assessment of Cause and Effect using "key assumptions check technique"
- And, challenge analysis using "devil's advocacy technique"

Adding to the above three techniques, I found Analysis of Competing Hypotheses is very much applicable to cyber security. Getting started in SATs for cyber security using these techniques is a good step one towards improving SOC personnel thinking, the challenge remains in measuring the improvement.
